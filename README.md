# Beer Shop
Beer Shop is a personal project designed for practicing layout development skills by a junior frontend developer. It serves as a clone of the original website [beerdome](https://www.beerdome.nl/en/). 
The project was built using JSX (not TSX, which was a significant oversight) and incorporates various technologies including Git, React, Chakra UI, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and Vite.

## Get Started
1. Install dependencies using `npm i` or `yarn`.
2. Then, just run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the dev server.

Also, you can see this project [deployed](https://beer-shop-rho.vercel.app/) using vercel.

The website supports viewing on different devices thanks to its responsive design implemented using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), ensuring a seamless experience for users on both desktop and mobile.
